Here is how the distribution is orgainized:

jain-sip-api      : contains the API
jain-sip-all      : contains everything prebuilt
jain-sip-src      : contains only the source files
jain-sip-javadoc  : contains only the javadoc
jain-sip-ri       : contains the JSR 32 Reference Implementation.
jain-sip-sdp      : contains the sip with SDP implementation. This includes the JSR 32 RI.
jain-sip-tck      : contains the TCK 

Since CVS does not assign a version number to the repository,
new version numbers are assigned manually by the project owner when
significant changes are made in the source code (for example new features
or bug fixes).
