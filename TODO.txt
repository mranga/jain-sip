Notes for the next version:

1. Add support for IMS headers.

2. Add AddressFactory.createAddress() ( no args ).

3. Intoduce AddressParametersHeader interface (SIP Servlets implementation support).

4. Respose.getStatusLine() returns the status line of the response ( useful
   for REFER NOTIFICATIONS ).
   
Note that all the Extension classes (ending with Ext ) can be used as they will be included 
in the next JAIN-SIP API.
