<P><font size="5"><u><b>What's this ?</b></u></font></P>

<P>This contains the code for a simple graphical user interface for
visualizing SIP signaling traces
</font>
</P>

<H2><u><b>Start the application</b></u></H2>
    <P> You have to start the application from the command line:
    either from the command line using ant: 
<ul>
<li>
    <font color = red > ant viewer
   </font>
</li>
<li>
   or the using makefile
   When viewing server log traces from a file use the
   command (assuming the class paths are properly set). 
   <br/>
   <font color = red > java tools.tracesviewer.TracesViewer -server_file serverlogfile
   </font>
   <br/>
   You can generate this log from the stack using the following property:
   <it>gov.nist.javax.sip.SERVER_LOG</it>. Set this property to serverlogfile
   and feed the generated trace to the tracesviewer. 
   Additionally, the <it>gov.nist.javax.sip.TRACE_LEVEL</it> should be 16 or higher.
</li>
<li>
   When viewing server log traces from a file use the
   command (assuming the class paths are properly set). <br/>
   <font color = red > java tools.tracesviewer.TracesViewer -debug_file debugLogfile
   </font>
   <br/>
   You can generate this log from the stack using the following property:
   <it>gov.nist.javax.sip.DEBUG_LOG</it>. 
   Set this property to debugLogfile and feed the generated 
   trace to the tracesviewer as above.
   Additionally, the <it>gov.nist.javax.sip.TRACE_LEVEL</it> 
   property should be 32 for debugging to be enabled. 
   A lot of debug information is generated so your application will 
   slow down when debug logs are being gathered. The Trace Viewer allows
   you to browse the debug log and message trace using the same UI when 
   this option is used.
</li>
<li> To obtain the trace file from a stack that has exported its trace file
via RMI invoke the tool as follows:
   <font  color="red"> make viewer  </font><br>
 or using the "runinit.sh" script on a Linux machine.
    <P> Usage:
        (if classpath correctly set)
      <font  color="red">  java tools.tracesviewer.TracesViewer -rmihost rmihost -rmiport rmiport -stackId stackId</font><br>
        <br>
        - "rmihost" is the host name/address for the RMI registry
        <br>
        - "rmiport" (optional) is the port for the rmi registry. Usually 
	not required if you are running from the default port of 1099.
        <br>
        - "stackId" is an identifier for the stack (i.e. the JAIN SIP Stack
	Name).
        <br>
        The values are defaulted to rmihost == 127.0.0.1
         rmiport ==  1099. StackId is mandatory. It is the stack name property
	of JAIN-SIP.
        <br>
</li>
</ul>
If everything is running OK, you will see a window with the retrieved traces,
paired and color coded by transaction identifier and organized by call ID.

<P> 
    Problems with the trace viewer:
</P> 
<P>
    - When the traces are refreshed, sometimes, you must resize the
    window to update the scroll bars and you will be able to see all
    the SIP messages.
