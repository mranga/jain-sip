<h1> <i><font color="blue">  NIST-SIP -- SIP Libraries and Tools for
the People!</font></i></h1>
 


<blockquote> 
 <h2> <u>What's in this Distribution?</u></h2>
 This distribution contains JAVA(TM) libraries for the following:
  <ul>
 <li> The official Reference Implementation of the JAIN SIP (v 1.2) API (JSR 32) maintenance
release. </li>
  <li>The Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK) for the maintenance release of JSR 32.
  <li>An implementation of the JAIN SDP API (JSR 141). </li>
 
  </ul>
    <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/%7Ehgs/sip/papers.html" target="_blank">The Session 
Initiation Protocol (RFC 3261) </a> is a text based signaling protocol that
is widely used for IP Telephony, Instant Messaging and and Internet Conferencing
applications.   
  <p>The Session Description Protocol ( RFC 2327 ) is used for describing 
media sessions and is frequently used in conjunction with SIP. </p>
  
  <p>Primarily, this distribution contains <a href="../javadoc/api/index.html" target="_blank">a protocol
stack/library that will help you build  and test SIP applications and servers.</a>
  </p>
  
  <h3> <u>Core Library and Stack Packages</u> </h3>
 This&nbsp; packages included in the gov.nist.javax.sip hierarchy form the
 reference implementation for JAIN-SIP 1.2   <a
 href="http://www.jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/maintenance/jsr032/" target="_blank"> 
JSR-32 maintenance release.</a> JAIN-SIP is a low level protocol API for
SIP.    
<h3> <u>Technology Compatibility Kit </u> </h3>
The source code for the technology compatibility kit is provided in
the directory src/test/tck.  
<h3> <u>Examples </u> </h3>
See the directory src/examples which contains several skeleton examples that illustrate how to use this software.  

   
  <h3> <u>Tools </u> </h3>
  <a href="tools/tracesviewer/README.html" target="_blank"> A trace viewer application that
 can be used to view the traces generated by the NIST Stack 
</a>  This is  our primary debugging tool. To report stack problems please
send us a debug log which can be input to the trace viewer to determine the
problem.
  <h2> <u>Build Instructions </u></h2>
  

It is highly recommended that you use J2SDK 1.4.2 or above.  
 However, you can also build RI under  JDK 1.3.1 (for use on PDA's). 
 

 Get the source from CVS or the nightly snapshot.
 Visit <a href="http://jain-sip.dev.java.net/source/browse/jain-sip/"> the
 stable repository on java.net </a> and follow the instructions there to
 get the source code. The build tool is Apache Ant. 
 
  <ul>
  <li> Install the ant junit extension: copy the file lib/junitXXX.jar to $ANT_HOME/lib
 </li>
 <li> The following ant targets are relevant: 
      <ul>
 <li> <font color="blue"> ant make </font> makes everything. A jar file JainSipRi1.2.jar will be generated which is the
RI for JAIN-SIP 1.2. </li>
        <li> <font color="blue"> ant javadoc </font> makes the documentation 
        </li>
        <li> <font color="blue"> ant tools </font> makes the tools </li>
        <li> <font color="blue"> ant examples </font> makes the examples. 
        </li>
        <li> <font color="blue"> ant compileri </font> makes just  the RI.
        <li> <font color="blue"> ant compiletck </font> makes  the
tck </li>
		<li> <font color="blue"> ant runtck </font> makes  the
tck and runs it</li>
      </ul>
 </li>
 
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>

Here is how you
can build and run the TCK against your own implementation:

<ul>
<li> make the RI using the instructions above. </li>
<li> Edit the tck.properties file to point to your implementation.
<it> <font color=blue> ant runtck </font> </it> 
</ul>


<h2><u> Reporting Bugs </u> </h2>
  <font color="red"> To report bugs you need to enable debugging and 
message logging.  
Set the gov.nist.javax.sip.TRACE_LEVEL property to DEBUG
enable debugging (see documentation for gov.nist.javax.SipStackImpl.java). 
Set the gov.nist.javax.sip.DEBUG_LOG property to  a writeable file name
(eg. debuglog.txt).
</font>  
Send us the generated debug log file to help us determine the problem. 
Post an issue to the bug tracker at the
<a href="http://jain-sip.dev.java.net/" target="_blank">jain-sip project at java.net </a>
so we can better track bugs, and  email us at
<a href="mailto:nist-sip-dev@antd.nist.gov">nist-sip-dev@antd.nist.gov</a>
to notify us.
Note that you need to join the project on java.net as an observer to 
post an issue. Follow the instructions on the java.net website above 
to do this.

<h2><u>Release Status</u> </h2>
 The RI and TCK are stable. 
<p/><font color=green> JAIN-SIP 1.2 is pending final review by the JCP PMO. 
</font>

<h2><u>Support </u> </h2>
</font>
<p> </p>
<font color="red"> As in much open of source software, 
the NIST-SIP is (and will remain) user supported and user tested code. 
Before you incorporate this into any product, please note that 
NIST provides no guarantee of continuing support.
You should regard this as experimental code. 
</font>

   
<p> 
However, take heart - the good news is that RI is stable and has 
been successfully deployed in several academic and commercial projects.  
The parser passes the SIPPING torture tests. 
It has been downloaded thousands of times and there is an active 
and supportive news group. 
Further, although this code is officially unsupported, 
we will try to keep up with your bug reports (and suggested fixes).  
You are part and parcel of this development effort
and NIST-SIP is only as good as the bug reports, 
feature requests and usage feedback reports you send in.   <br>
